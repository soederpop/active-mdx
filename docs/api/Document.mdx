# Document Class

## API

### Instance Methods


#### save

Tells the collection this document belongs to to save its content to disk.  It will use Document#rawContent which will serialize the yaml frontmatter and prepend it to the MDX code from the current AST.
- `{Object} options` options to pass to Collection#saveItem

#### toModel

Convert this document to a Model.  You can either pass the model class as an option,
or we will attempt to determine the model class by using the Model.prefix and matching it
against the beginning of the document's id.
- `{Object} options` 
- `{Model} options.model` the model class to use

Returns `{Model} an instance of the model class for this document`

#### toJSON

Serialize this document as JSON.

Returns `{Object}`

#### query

Creates a new instance of the ASTQuery class for a given AST.
- `{MDAst} ast` the ast, defaults to this document's AST

Returns `{AstQuery}`

#### extractSection

Extract a section of the document, starting with a heading.  This will return all of the nodes
which are underneath a given heading.  It will stop searching when it encounters another heading
of the same depth, or the end of the document.
- `{ASTNode} startHeading` the heading to start the section with

Returns `{Array[ASTNode]}`

#### replaceContent

#### appendContent

#### stringify

Converts an AST into MDX code.
- `{MDAst} [ast=this.ast]` the AST to convert



### Instance Properties


#### rawContent

Returns the raw content of the document, including yaml frontmatter.

#### id

Returns the document's id.  The ID will be the relative path to collection.rootPath, minus the file extension.

#### title

Returns the document title.  The title will be the string contents of the first heading in the document,
otherwise it will be the id of the document.

#### astQuery

Returns an instance of AstQuery which provides helpers
for querying the AST nodes in this document.

Returns `{AstQuery}`

#### nodes

Returns an instance of NodeShortcuts which provides getters
for common queries for our nodes.

Returns `{NodeShortcuts}`

#### utils

Provides access to common utility functions for working with ASTs and nodes.

Type `{Object}`

#### meta

Gets the YAML frontmatter of this document as a JavaScript object.

Type `{Object}`

#### content

Gets the MDX code content of this document, either by using the file's contents that was passed
from the collection, or by stringifying the AST in its current state.

#### processor

Provides access to the MDX AST compiler

#### ast

Gets the MDAST for this document.  If the document was created with one,
it will use that. Otherwise it will use Document#processor to compile the MDX code into
a crawlable AST.

Type `{MDAst}`

#### attributes

Provides access to the unique parts of this document.

#### collection

Returns the collection this document belongs to.

Type `{Collection}`

#### linkedDocuments

Returns any documents which are in the collection, and linked via an href attribute.
