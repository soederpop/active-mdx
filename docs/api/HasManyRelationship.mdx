# HasManyRelationship extends [Relationship](./Relationship.mdx)

A `HasManyRelationship` instance is returned when you run `modelInstance.hasMany("Children").

```javascript
import { Model } from "active-mdx"

class Author extends Model {
  posts() {
    // assumes a model class Post has been registered with the collection
    return this.hasMany("Post", {
      heading: "posts"
    })
  }
}
```
