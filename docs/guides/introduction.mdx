# Introduction to ActiveMDX

ActiveMDX lets you define a Content Model to represent different markdown / mdx files in your project.

The Content Model lets you work with your writing, and the concepts and things you are writing about, as data.

## An Example ActiveMDX Project

[The Software Development Lifecycle](https://github.com/soederpop/active-mdx/tree/master/examples/sdlc) contains documentation for an imaginary software project.

Many of us have worked with tools like Jira, or Github issues.

Epics are categories of stories, and stories represent individual features or tasks required to make the software work.
