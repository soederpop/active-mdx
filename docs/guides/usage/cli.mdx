# AMDX CLI Usage

The active-mdx package provides you with an executable `amdx` which can be used to interact with an ActiveMDX Collection.

## Running actions on models

A Model Class can define actions that can be run on instances of the model.

```javascript
class MyModel extends Model {}

MyModel.action("myAction", async function (model) {
  console.log(`Running my action on ${model.title}`)
})
```

An action can do anything using the model instance and any data it provides.

Running the following command in your shell will run the `myAction` function we registered on each instance of the models whose ids are passed to the command:

```shell
$ amdx action myAction some/document/id some-other/document/id another-document/id
```

This will result in

```
Running my action on Some Document ID
Running my action on Some Other Document ID
Running my action on Another Document ID
```

## Expanding Documents

By default, every model supports an "expand" action.

This will look at the model class's relationships and will generate new documents for each relationship if they don't exist.

To support the expand action, a class needs to define a static sections property which is an array of strings. The values of this array should be the instance method names on the class which return relationships.

Below is an example of an `Epic` class from the [SDLC Example](https://github.com/soederpop/active-mdx/tree/master/examples/sdlc)

```javascript
export default class Epic extends Model {
  static sections = ["stories"]

  get defaults() {
    return {
      meta: {
        status: "created"
      }
    }
  }

  get isComplete() {
    return this.stories()
      .fetchAll()
      .every((story) => story.isComplete)
  }

  stories() {
    return this.hasMany(Story, {
      heading: "stories",
      meta: () => ({ epic: this.title.toLowerCase() })
    })
  }

  static is(document) {
    return document.id.startsWith("epic")
  }
}
```

We can expand an epic document

```shell
$ amdx action expand epics/authentication
```

This will look at the stories subheading

```markdown
## Stories

### A User should be able to register

As a User I would like to register so that I can use the application.

### A User should be able to login

As a User I would like to login so that I can use the application.

### A User should be able to logout

As a User I would like to logout so that I can use the application.
```

And for each item under it, it will attempt to look for a related story document, e.g `stories/authentication/a-user-should-be-able-to-register.mdx` and if it does not exist, will create it for us.
