# ActiveMDX

With ActiveMDX, you can extract meaningful information from the content of your writing. Structured writing can become structured data. Combine this with the power of React and MDX, and ActiveMDX can be used to build applications that are powered by your writing.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) gives us the ability to display markdown writing with React components.

Traditional markdown renders static HTML. MDX renders as React components and gives you the ability to control how each standard markdown html element gets rendered. By itself, this is a very powerful way to display your writing and gives you a lot of creative power. People have used it to build interactive code demos which you can live edit and see the results rendered in real time, and much more.

## Collections of structured documents

ActiveMDX provides a [Collection](/api/Collection) class that turns a folder of MDX documents into a queryable database. Each different type of document is a Model, or a table in a database. Each document of those types are the rows in that database.

```javascript
import { Collection } from "@active-mdx/core"

import Epic from "./models/Epic"
import Story from "./models/Story"

const collection = new Collection({
  rootPath: "./docs"
})

await collection.load()

const completedStories = await Story.query((qb) =>
  qb.where("status", "completed")
).fetchAll()

// register a common query
Epic.query("completedStories", (qb) => qb.where("status", "completed"))

// run the common query
Epic.query("completedStories")
```

## ActiveMDX provides an action system

With the action system, you can run functions using your collection and different models. In the example I've written about here, you could do things like publish all the stories to Github or Jira using their API. To do that we just define the action `publish-to-github`

```javascript
Story.action("publish-to-github", async function (story) {
  await githubAPI.issues.create({
    title,
    body: story.document.content,
    labels: story.meta.labels
  })
})
```

We can then use the [AMDX CLI](/guides/usage/cli) to run that action

```bash
$ amdx action publish-to-github stories/authentication/a-user-should-be-able-to-register
```
