# Model Validations

ActiveMDX lets you define a validation schema for your models. This schema represents what a model will turn an mdx document into when you call `toJSON` on it.

This validation schema can be used to ensure your documents provide the data you expect them to. Think of it like a linting tool.

You can validate a model individually using the `amdx` CLI.

```shell
$ amdx validate epics/authentication
```

This will either tell you it is ok, or give you a list of problems you need to fix.

You can also validate the entire collection:

```shell
$ amdx validate all
```

You can use the validation commands to help you as you author the documents, or you can use it as part of a continuous integration or build process, as the process will exit with an error code if any of the validations fail.

## joi library validations

The ActiveMDX Model class provides access to the joi library, for defining a schema for your models.

```js
import { Model } from "@active-mdx/core"

export default class Post extends Model {
  static get schema() {
    const { joi } = this

    return {
      title: joi.string().required(),
      body: joi.string().required()
    }
  }
}
```

See [their website for the documentation.](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.5.0)

## API

You can access the validation system programmatically using the `validate` method on the model class.

```js
const post = collection.getModel("posts/intro")

await post.validate()

post.hasErrors === true

post.errorMessages ===
  {
    title: {
      message: '"title" is required'
    }
  }
```
