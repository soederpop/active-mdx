# Software Project Demo

This website is built using [ActiveMDX](https://active-mdx.soederpop.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

ActiveMDX allows us to develop content models for domain specific writing. In this case, the writing is software project requirements for the purposes of planning a software project's delivery.
A Content Model allows us to treat specific types of documents as data objects, and collections of these documents like a database table. This gives us, and importantly, software, new ways to interact with the writing.

The source code for this project plan is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/soederpop/active-mdx-software-project-starter).

There is a lot to be said about the value of software planning documentation being version controlled, and living along side the developer's work product.

## [Epics](/epics)

Epics are the main groups of functionality we intend to deliver.

## [Stories](/stories)

Stories are individual features that belong to an epic and represent work to be done.

## [Scope of Work](/scope-of-work)

Scope of work presents the work that is to be done in terms of time estimates and costs.
