# Headless or Native Storefront

We need to decide whether to use a headless frontend, or to use BigCommerce's native stencil theme.

## Options

### Headless Storefront

#### Pros

- Complete customization
- Best possible cache performance for frontend

#### Cons

- Requires development / effort

### Native Stencil Theme

#### Pros

- Can leverage existing themes and templates
- Leverages BigCommerce for hosting the frontend

#### Cons

- Limited options for customization
- Slower performance compared to headless static HTML behind a CDN
