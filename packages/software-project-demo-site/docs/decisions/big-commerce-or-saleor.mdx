# BigCommerce or Saleor

We need to make a decision about which e-commerce platform to use. The two main options are BigCommerce or Saleor.

- Bigcommerce is a hosted platform that we would pay monthly to use.
- Saleor is a self-hosted open source platform that we would need to host and maintain ourselves.

## Options

Talk through the different options for this decision.

### BigCommerce

[BigCommerce](https://bigcommerce.com) is a hosted e-commerce platform with a lot of options for integration with popular third-party services. You can host your entire store on their servers, or use their platform as an API.

#### Pros

- Scaling, Availability, and PCI Compliance is guaranteed by BigCommerce
- Plug and play integration with most major third party providers

#### Cons

- May be limited by the feature set of the platform
- Customized checkout experience has limitations
- Monthly subscription costs and transaction fees

### Option Two

[Saleor](https://www.saleor.io) is a self-hosted e-commerce solution that is open source.

#### Pros

- Can be heavily customized
- Free

#### Cons

- Scaling, Availability, PCI compliance is our responsibility
- Customizations will cost developer time and money
