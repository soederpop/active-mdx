# SDLC Example

This example project contains a bunch of MDX / Markdown files that describe the planning and requirements for a web application that will be developed.

In Agile software development, requirements are captured in the form of user stories.  User stories describe a user's goals and how they plan to accomplish them and why.

An `Epic` is a high level description of a category or group of user `Story`.

We have an [Epic Model](./models/Epic.js) and a [Story Model](./models/Story.js) which are used to represent the mdx files in [epics](./epics) and [stories](./stories) folders respectively.
